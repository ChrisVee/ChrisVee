# 🏄🏽‍♂️ About Me
I'm a Frontend Developer from Los Angeles, currently living in Paris. My background is in digital marketing, specifically in the affiliate marketing, eCommerce, and Fintech space, but I've decided to swap Facebook campaigns for VSCode sessions and take a dive into Frontend Development. I'm currently on a self-study mission to reach the pinnacle of indiehacker greatness, or at least make $5k/mo from something I built ... no big deal! 💪

As a self-starter with a background in sports, I'm especially passionate about healthy, intentional living while making a difference in the tech industry. I've got a sharp eye for product and design. I love communities, productivity, and automations which is why I find projects around composability and React components to be one of my favourite parts of the job. So let's build something epic together and bring the internet closer 🚀

• 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js <br>
• ⚡️ Fun fact: I'm the rare breed who loves building AND selling
